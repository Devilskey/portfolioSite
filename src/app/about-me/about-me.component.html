    Hi, my name is Bram Hendriks. I am a student at Vista College following the education software development. <br/> 
    I am programming since 2017 as a Hobby and started in the unity game engine. Now i'm trying to make from my hobby my job. <br/> 
    The reason I got into programming is because I am always looking for a challenge and learn something new.<br/>
     Working mostly with languages based on C like C# and C++ as my hobby. I started out with making videos games. <br/>
     i am now making my own cms and trying to make a small social media site like tiktok with a few friends to learn how something like that works.<br/>
